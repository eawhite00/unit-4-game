This is the crystal game!

Each crystal is worth a random number of points between 1-12, re-initialized for each round of the game.

You have a target score to reach in each round, randomized between 19-120.

Clicking a crystal adds its value to your sore. Reaching your target score gets you a win, while exceeding it causes you to lose.
